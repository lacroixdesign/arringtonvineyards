          Rich, complex flavors of chocolate covered cherries, mocha and clove.
        %h5 Winemaker Notes:
        %p
          This &ldquo;Port&rdquo; style wine was made from our hillside Chambourcin vineyard. Grape spirits (brandy) was added to halt fermentation and preserve the sweetness of the grape juice. 22 months of barrel aging in French and American oak added mocha and clove flavors.
        %h5 Food Pairing:
        %p
          Stilton blue cheese, cheesecake, chocolates, berry desserts, dates and nuts.
